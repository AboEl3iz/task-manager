Excel Export Functionality
The exportTasksToExcel method generates a detailed Excel sheet with the following columns and data structure:

Task ID	Description	Status	Priority	Due Date	Progress (%)	Created By	Assigned To	Checklist Completion
1	Complete project docs	In Progress	High	2025-04-20	50%	John Doe	Jane Smith, Mike D.	2/4 done
2	Prepare presentation	Completed	Medium	2025-04-15	100%	Alice Brown	Bob White	5/5 done
3	Update software versions	Pending	Low	2025-04-25	0%	Charlie Lee	None	0/3 done
Column Descriptions:

Task ID: Unique identifier of the task.
Description: Task description provided during creation.
Status: Current status of the task (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed).
Priority: Task priority (e.g., high, medium, low).
